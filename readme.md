## Motivation

As a kid, one of my teachers had us do a creative writing exercise. Each student was given two small slips of paper. We wrote one noun and one adjective each. All the adjectives were placed in one hat and all the nouns in another. Each student drew one adjective and one noun, and we had to write stories based on the title formed by the two words we drew.

We did the exercise a few times, and I remember it being fun. I can only remember one title - "Angry Marijuana".
